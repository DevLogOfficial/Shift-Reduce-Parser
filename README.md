# Shift-Reduce-Parser

This desktop application is a dynamic shift-reduce parser programmed using C# and the .NET Framework. The program provides the user with the ability to input custom grammar rules and then generate a parse table for the entered grammar. Once a parse table is generated, the program grants the user access to the parsing section. In the parse section, a user can manually input expressions to parse. Once the parsing process begins, the program will run through the steps visually to display what is occurring.
